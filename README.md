# Fake-news-detection-project

This project aims to develop a classification model that identifies whether a news article is fake or real. Using machine learning techniques, we will build a model capable of categorizing new texts based on the dataset provided.

The dataset for this project can be accessed at the following link:

Dataset URL = https://bit.ly/319PifQ

The dataset contains news articles labeled as either fake or real, which will be used for training and testing the classification model.

**Project Workflow**

**Data Exploration:**

The first step involves exploring the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics. We will analyze the distribution of the labels (fake or real), investigate word frequency, and observe patterns in the text. Data visualization and statistical summaries will be used to gain insights.

**Data Preparation:**

In this step, we prepare the data for modeling. This involves:

Cleaning the text (removing punctuation, stopwords, and irrelevant characters).
Tokenization and vectorization (converting text into numerical form using methods such as Bag of Words or TF-IDF).
Splitting the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

**Modeling:**

We will apply different machine learning algorithms to create a classification model. Some commonly used models for this task include Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, and Random Forest. We may also perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

**Model Evaluation:**

The performance of the models will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation will ensure the model generalizes well to new, unseen data. The best-performing model will be selected for final use.

**Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following libraries installed before running the project:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK or SpaCy (for text preprocessing)
- Matplotlib or Seaborn (for visualizations)
  
**How to Run the Project**

Download or clone the project files to your local machine.

Open the project in Jupyter Notebook or a Python IDE.

Follow the steps outlined:

- Data Exploration

- Data Modeling
- 
Run the cells in sequence to build and evaluate the fake news detection model.

**Future Enhancements**

Integrate deep learning models such as LSTMs or BERT to improve classification accuracy.

Explore techniques for detecting bias or other patterns in fake news articles.

Improve real-time fake news detection by integrating the model with news APIs.

**Conclusion**

This project will result in a model capable of accurately categorizing news articles as fake or real. It demonstrates the complete machine learning pipeline, from data exploration to model evaluation.
